4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Answer:Though Resnet and vgg were correct. Overall,the best-performing model architecture for this task was ResNet, because of its runtime of 00:00:03. VGG took twice the time to complete the task, 00:00:07.
